 Problem:    implement queue using stacks
 Difficulty: easy
 Notes:
Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
peek() -- Get the front element.
empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.
Notes:
You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).

class MyQueue {
    Stack<Integer> queue = new Stack<Integer>();
    // Push element x to the back of queue.
    public void push(int x) {
        Stack<Integer> temp = new Stack<Integer>();
        while(!queue.empty()){
            temp.push(queue.pop());
        }
        queue.push(x);
        while(!temp.empty()){
            queue.push(temp.pop());
        }
    }

    // Removes the element from in front of queue.
    public void pop() {
        queue.pop();
    }

    // Get the front element.
    public int peek() {
        return queue.peek();
    }

    // Return whether the queue is empty.
    public boolean empty() {
        return queue.empty();
    }
